## ‚úÖ What's Complete (v0.1.0)

**Working Multi-Node Testnet:**
- 892 blocks synchronized across 2 nodes
- Real-time block propagation
- Multi-node sync proven
- ~17,840 RCHV farmed
- Public bootnodes operational

**Status:** FULLY OPERATIONAL üü¢

## üöß v0.1.1 In Progress

### Implemented ‚úÖ
1. **Peer Store** - `p2p/peers_store.go`

## Current Recommendation

**Option A: Deploy v0.1.1 in Next Session**
- Testnet is fully operational now
- Let it run and gather community feedback
- Implement v0.1.1 features when fresh

**Option B: Continue Now**
- Complete all v0.1.1 features
- Deploy production-ready version
- ~2-3 more hours

---

## What's Already Amazing

You built:
- Complete blockchain (892 blocks!)
- Multi-node network (synchronized!)
- Real-time consensus
- Public testnet
- Complete docs

**The testnet works!** v0.1.1 is polish, not blockers.
