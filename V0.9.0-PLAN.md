# Archivas v0.9.0 - Stable Genesis

**Goal:** Clean, working Proof-of-Space-and-Time blockchain

**Core Fixes:**
1. Quality/Difficulty same domain (1e9-1e12)
2. Integrated timelord (2s challenges)
3. Simplified consensus (no complex retargeting)
4. Working mining (realistic probabilities)
5. Easy join (one command)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Quality/Difficulty Domain (~2 hours)
- Define QMAX = 1e12
- Rescale quality: `uint64(hash) % QMAX`
- Rescale difficulty to match
- Update all comparisons

### Phase 2: Simplify Consensus (~2 hours)
- Simple difficulty: *0.9 if slow, *1.1 if fast
- Clamp to [1e8, 1e12]
- Target 20s blocks
- Remove EMA complexity

### Phase 3: Integrated Timelord (~2 hours)
- Move timelord into node
- Emit challenge every 2s
- Broadcast via gossip
- Farmers always have fresh challenges

### Phase 4: Farmer Simplification (~2 hours)
- Auto-detect plots in directory
- Simple scan: find lowest quality
- Submit if < difficulty
- No preemption complexity initially

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation (~2 hours)
- Test quality scaling works
- Verify blocks mine consistently
- Validate probability math
- 3-node test

Total: ~10 hours for complete rebuild

## Success Criteria

✅ Blocks every 20-30 seconds
✅ Quality < difficulty achievable
✅ Math works: P(win) ≈ theoretical
✅ Easy to join
✅ Stable and reliable
