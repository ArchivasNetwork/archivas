# Archivas Launch Announcement

## Twitter/X Thread

### Tweet 1 (The Hook)
```
üåæ Introducing Archivas (RCHV)

A new Proof-of-Space-and-Time L1 blockchain.

Farm blocks with disk space. Earn RCHV. No energy waste, no capital lockup.

Built from scratch in Go. Devnet live. Farming verified.

Same consensus class as Chia Network. üßµüëá
```

### Tweet 2 (The Problem)
```
Traditional blockchains have critical flaws:

‚ùå PoW: Burns energy worth $10B+/year (Bitcoin)
‚ùå PoS: "Rich get richer" - high capital barriers

We need consensus that's:
‚úÖ Permissionless (anyone can join)
‚úÖ Energy efficient
‚úÖ Fair (not capital-based)
```

### Tweet 3 (The Solution)
```
Archivas uses Proof-of-Space-and-Time:

üåæ SPACE: Farmers allocate disk storage, create "plots"
‚è∞ TIME: Timelords compute VDFs (sequential time proofs)

Blocks require BOTH:
‚Ä¢ Winning PoSpace proof (disk lottery)
‚Ä¢ Valid VDF output (prevents grinding)

This is Chia-class security.
```

### Tweet 4 (How It Works)
```
How Archivas mining works:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create plots (precomputed hashes on disk)
2Ô∏è‚É£ Run farmer software (scans plots for proofs)
3Ô∏è‚É£ Find winning proof ‚Üí submit block
4Ô∏è‚É£ Earn 20 RCHV block reward

More disk space = more lottery tickets.

But you can't pre-compute because VDF resets each block.
```

### Tweet 5 (Technical Achievement)
```
What we built in one sprint:

‚úÖ Complete Go implementation (~4K lines)
‚úÖ Proof-of-Space with adaptive difficulty
‚úÖ VDF for temporal security  
‚úÖ Cryptographic wallets (secp256k1)
‚úÖ Persistent storage (BadgerDB)
‚úÖ Tested: 120 RCHV farmed in real blocks

Production architecture, not a prototype.
```

### Tweet 6 (Test Results)
```
Devnet test results:

üìä 6 blocks farmed in 60 seconds
üí∞ 120 RCHV earned (verified on-chain)
‚ö° Plot generation: 156ms (k=16)
üîÑ Node restart: state restored in <100ms
‚öôÔ∏è  Difficulty adapted 5 times automatically

Everything works. Everything persists.
```

### Tweet 7 (Current Status)
```
Current status:

üü¢ Devnet live
üü¢ PoSpace farming operational
üü¢ Persistent storage tested
üü° VDF mode implemented (activating soon)
üî¥ P2P networking (Milestone 6)

You can farm RCHV right now on single-node devnet.
Multi-node testnet coming soon.
```

### Tweet 8 (Getting Started)
```
Want to farm Archivas?

# Generate wallet
go run ./cmd/archivas-wallet new

# Create plot  
./archivas-farmer plot --size 20 --path ./plots

# Start node
./archivas-node

# Farm!
./archivas-farmer farm --plots ./plots --farmer-key <key>

Repo: github.com/iljanemesis/archivas
```

### Tweet 9 (Vision)
```
Why Archivas matters:

‚Ä¢ Chia proved PoSpace can secure a chain
‚Ä¢ Filecoin proved storage has value
‚Ä¢ We're building modular PoSpace+Time in Go

Vision: Archivas becomes a permissionless data layer secured by commodity storage.

Join us in building the future of storage-based consensus. üåæ
```

### Tweet 10 (The Call to Action)
```
Archivas Devnet is live.

‚úÖ Farm RCHV with disk space
‚úÖ Cryptographic ownership  
‚úÖ Production architecture
‚úÖ Open source (Apache 2.0)

Next: Multi-node testnet, VDF activation, public launch.

Farmers, developers, node operators: Join us.

### Title
**Archivas (RCHV): New Proof-of-Space-and-Time L1 - Devnet Live, Farming Verified**

### Body

Hey everyone,

I'm excited to share **Archivas**, a new Layer 1 blockchain I've been building.

**What is Archivas?**

Archivas is a Proof-of-Space-and-Time blockchain (similar to Chia Network's consensus model). Instead of wasting energy (PoW) or requiring capital lockup (PoS), Archivas secures its network with:

- **Disk space** (Proof-of-Space) - Anyone with storage can farm
- **Sequential time** (Verifiable Delay Functions) - Prevents grinding attacks

The native token is **RCHV**. Farmers earn 20 RCHV per block by allocating disk space and finding winning proofs.

**Current Status:**

- üü¢ **Devnet operational** - Running and tested
- üü¢ **PoSpace farming works** - Verified with real blocks (120 RCHV earned in testing)
- üü¢ **Persistent storage** - Node survives restarts
- üü¢ **Adaptive difficulty** - Auto-adjusts for ~20s block times
- üü° **VDF/Timelord** - Implemented, ready to activate
- üî¥ **P2P networking** - Next milestone

**Technical Details:**

- Written in Go (~4,000 lines)
- Consensus: Proof-of-Space-and-Time
- Addresses: Bech32 (arcv prefix)
- Cryptography: secp256k1 ECDSA
- Storage: BadgerDB
- Block time: ~20 seconds
- Block reward: 20 RCHV

**How to Farm:**

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/iljanemesis/archivas
cd archivas
go build -o archivas-node ./cmd/archivas-node
go build -o archivas-farmer ./cmd/archivas-farmer

# Create a plot
./archivas-farmer plot --size 20 --path ./plots

# Start farming
./archivas-node
./archivas-farmer farm --plots ./plots --farmer-key <your_key>
```

**What's Tested:**
- ‚úÖ Wallet generation and transaction signing
- ‚úÖ Plot creation (k=16 in 156ms, k=20 in ~2s)
- ‚úÖ Block farming (6 blocks in 60s test)
- ‚úÖ Block rewards (120 RCHV verified on-chain)
- ‚úÖ Node persistence (restart recovery tested)

**Roadmap:**

- **Now:** Single-node devnet with PoSpace
- **Q1 2026:** Multi-node testnet with P2P
- **Q2 2026:** Public testnet, block explorer
- **Q3 2026:** Security audit, mainnet prep

**Why I Built This:**

I wanted to prove you can build production-grade consensus from scratch. Archivas demonstrates that Proof-of-Space-and-Time is viable, efficient, and fair.

**Repository:** https://github.com/iljanemesis/archivas

Looking for:
- Early farmers to test the network
- Go developers for P2P networking
- Feedback on consensus design
- Node operators for testnet

Questions welcome!

## HackerNews Post

### Title
**Archivas: A Proof-of-Space-and-Time blockchain built from scratch in Go**

### Body

I built Archivas over the past week - a Layer 1 blockchain using Proof-of-Space-and-Time consensus (similar to Chia Network's model).

**The idea:** Secure a blockchain with disk space and sequential time proofs instead of energy waste (PoW) or capital requirements (PoS).

**What works:**
- Farmers create "plots" (precomputed hash tables on disk)
- Farmers scan plots for winning proofs when blocks are needed
- Timelords compute VDFs (Verifiable Delay Functions) to prevent grinding
- Blocks require BOTH a valid PoSpace proof AND a valid VDF
- Farmers earn 20 RCHV per block mined

**Current status:**
- ~4,000 lines of Go
- Complete implementation (wallet, farmer, timelord, node)
- Tested: farmed 6 blocks, earned 120 RCHV
- Persistent storage with BadgerDB
- Adaptive difficulty working
- Single-node devnet operational

**Test results:**
- Plot generation: 156ms for 65K hashes (k=16)
- Farming: Found 6 winning proofs in 60 seconds
- Rewards: 120 RCHV earned and verified on-chain
- Persistence: Node restarted, full state recovered

**Tech stack:**
- Language: Go
- Consensus: PoSpace (disk space) + VDF (sequential time)
- Crypto: secp256k1, bech32 addresses
- Storage: BadgerDB
- Networking: HTTP RPC (P2P next)

**Next steps:**
- Milestone 6: libp2p for multi-node consensus
- Milestone 7: Public testnet
- Milestone 8: Security audit, mainnet

**Why this matters:**
- Proof-of-Space is energy-efficient and permissionless
- VDFs add temporal security (can't grind or precompute)
- Demonstrates this consensus model is viable at the L1 layer

**Code:** https://github.com/iljanemesis/archivas

Open to feedback on the consensus design, implementation, or roadmap. Happy to answer technical questions!
