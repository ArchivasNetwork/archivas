# 🎉 Milestone 3 COMPLETE: Proof-of-Space Farming

## The Moment Archivas Became Real

**Archivas is no longer a prototype. It's a working Proof-of-Space L1 blockchain.**

## What Just Happened

### Farmer Rewards Verified
```json
{
  "address": "arcv1q84xt5pzcslhnjsc2h2t9cnuxrn0e2u2u97jnl",
  "balance": 12000000000,  // 120.00000000 RCHV
  "nonce": 0
}
```

**120 RCHV earned from farming!** (6 blocks × 20 RCHV)

### Difficulty Adjustment Working
```
Height 1: difficulty=1125899906842624
Height 2: difficulty=1294784892869017
Height 3: difficulty=776870935721410
Height 4: difficulty=388435467860705
Height 5: difficulty=194217733930352
Height 6: difficulty=97108866965176
```

Difficulty adaptively adjusted to maintain target block time!

## How to Farm Archivas

### 1. Generate a Farmer Wallet
```bash
go run ./cmd/archivas-wallet new
```

Save your private key!

### 2. Create a Plot
```bash
./archivas-farmer plot \
  --path ./plots \
  --size 18 \
  --farmer-key <your_public_key_hex>
```

Plot sizes:
- k=16: ~2 MB, 65K hashes (fast testing)
- k=20: ~32 MB, 1M hashes (small farm)
- k=24: ~512 MB, 16M hashes (medium farm)
- k=28: ~8 GB, 256M hashes (large farm)

### 3. Start the Node
```bash
./archivas-node
```

You'll see:
```
🌾 Waiting for farmers to submit blocks...
[consensus] height=0 difficulty=1125899906842624
```

### 4. Start Farming
```bash
./archivas-farmer farm \
  --plots ./plots \
  --farmer-key <your_private_key_hex> \
  --node http://localhost:8080
```

When you win:
```
🎉 Found winning proof!
✅ Block submitted successfully for height 1
```

### 5. Check Your Rewards
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/balance/<your_farmer_address>
```

Every block you mine = **20 RCHV**!

## Architecture

### Block Structure
```go
type Block struct {
    Height        uint64
    TimestampUnix int64
    PrevHash      [32]byte
    Txs           []ledger.Transaction
    Proof         *pospace.Proof      // PoSpace proof
    FarmerAddr    string               // Receives reward
}
```

### Proof Structure
```go
type Proof struct {
    Challenge    [32]byte  // Current challenge
    PlotID       [32]byte  // Which plot
    Index        uint64    // Which hash in plot
    Hash         [32]byte  // The hash value
    Quality      uint64    // Lower is better
    FarmerPubKey [33]byte  // Farmer's key
}
```

### Difficulty Algorithm
- Target: ~20 second average block time
- Window: Last 10 blocks
- Adjustment: Ratio of actual vs target time
- Clamped: 0.5x to 2x per adjustment
- Bounds: Min 2^40, Max 2^60

### Challenge Generation
```
Genesis: H("Archivas Devnet Genesis")
Block N: H(prevBlockHash || N)
```

## What Makes This Special

### Compared to Bitcoin (Proof-of-Work)
- ✅ No energy waste - disk space instead of computation
- ✅ Reusable plots - generate once, farm forever
- ✅ Lower barrier to entry - anyone with disk space can farm

### Compared to Proof-of-Stake
- ✅ No "rich get richer" - disk space is the resource
- ✅ Permissionless - no minimum stake required
- ✅ More decentralized - cheaper to participate

### Compared to Chia
- ✅ Simpler plot format (no k1/k2 tables)
- ✅ Native transaction support with signatures
- ✅ Adaptive difficulty from day 1
- ⏸️ No VDF yet (Milestone 4)

## Files Created

### Consensus
- `consensus/consensus.go` - PoSpace verification, difficulty tracking
- `consensus/difficulty.go` - Adaptive difficulty algorithm

- Implement sequential time proofs
- Prevent grinding attacks
- Enable finality guarantees

### Milestone 5: Full PoSpace+Time Consensus

## Try It Yourself

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start node
./archivas-node

# Terminal 2: Generate wallet
go run ./cmd/archivas-wallet new

# Terminal 3: Create plot
./archivas-farmer plot --size 18 --path ./my-plots

# Terminal 4: Farm!
./archivas-farmer farm \
  --plots ./my-plots \
  --farmer-key <your_privkey> \
  --node http://localhost:8080

# Terminal 5: Watch rewards
watch -n 2 'curl -s http://localhost:8080/balance/<your_addr> | python3 -m json.tool'
```

## The Moment of Truth

```
Before Milestone 3:
❌ Time-based blocks (centralized)
❌ No farmer participation
❌ No real consensus

After Milestone 3:
✅ Space-based blocks (decentralized)
✅ Farmers compete with disk space
✅ Real Proof-of-Space consensus
✅ Block rewards to farmers
✅ Adaptive difficulty
✅ Working devnet

ARCHIVAS IS LIVE! 🚀
```
